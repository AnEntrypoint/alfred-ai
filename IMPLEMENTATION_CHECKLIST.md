# Alfred AI - Complete Implementation Checklist

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Fixed Bash Execution Wrapper
- **Issue**: `-c` flag was causing syntax errors with JavaScript parentheses
- **Solution**: Use stdin mode for bash (spawn without -c, write to stdin)
- **Location**: `alfred-cli.js:244-251`
- **Test**: `test-alfred-features.js` - "Bash stdin mode" test passes ✅

### 2. 3-Second Async Execution with Process Tracking
- **Feature**: Executions complete synchronously if <3s, otherwise go to background
- **Implementation**:
  - Timer set for 3 seconds: `alfred-cli.js:293`
  - Process tracking map: `alfred-cli.js:17` (constructor)
  - Background processes stored with metadata: `alfred-cli.js:300-312`
- **User Visibility**: Process ID returned, logs to console
- **Test**: Verified with timeout logic test ✅

### 3. Comprehensive Logging to Console
- **Feature**: All output streams to console in real-time with [processId] prefix
- **Implementation**:
  - Stdout streaming: `alfred-cli.js:279-284`
  - Stderr streaming: `alfred-cli.js:286-291`
  - Process status updates: `alfred-cli.js:297-298`
  - Background updates: `alfred-cli.js:383-391`
- **User Visibility**: Every log line shows `[proc_X]` prefix ✅

### 4. Enhanced Tool Descriptions
- **Feature**: Agent receives comprehensive execution model documentation
- **Implementation**: `alfred-cli.js:167-227`
- **Includes**:
  - Execution model (0-3s, 3s+, async)
  - Log management (60s clearing, eager queuing)
  - Efficient waiting instructions
  - Process control tools
  - Workflow examples
  - Best practices (port detection, error recovery, validation, file ops)
- **Agent Knowledge**: Complete understanding of system ✅

### 5. Port Detection and Error Repetition Intelligence
- **Port Detection**: Added to best practices in tool description
  - Check ports with `lsof -i :PORT`
  - Start with uncommon ports (4000-9000)
  - Detect "Cannot GET" errors as port conflicts
- **Error Tracking**: `alfred-cli.js:410-421`
  - Tracks first 100 chars of errors
  - Alerts agent after 2 occurrences
  - Prevents infinite loops
- **Test**: Error tracking test passes ✅

### 6. 60-Second Log Clearing with Eager Queuing
- **Feature**: Background logs cleared every 60s, queued for agent
- **Implementation**:
  - Log monitoring setup: `alfred-cli.js:368-408`
  - Uses closure to avoid duplicate listeners
  - Clears logs after collection: `alfred-cli.js:379`
  - Queues for agent: `alfred-cli.js:393-399`
  - Injected before agent turn: `alfred-cli.js:521-540`
- **No Repetition**: Logs cleared immediately after reading ✅
- **Test**: Pending updates queue test passes ✅

### 7. Kill Process Tool
- **Feature**: Agent can terminate background processes
- **Implementation**: `alfred-cli.js:448-461, 594-633`
- **Capabilities**:
  - Graceful SIGTERM, then SIGKILL if needed
  - Delivers ALL remaining logs
  - Clears monitor interval
  - Removes from tracking
- **User Visibility**: Console shows kill status ✅

### 8. Wait For Logs Tool
- **Feature**: Efficient 60s wait instead of sleep commands
- **Implementation**: `alfred-cli.js:462-474, 634-646`
- **Behavior**:
  - Waits 60 seconds
  - Background processes continue
  - Logs automatically queued
  - Agent notified after wait
- **Efficiency**: No blocking, processes run during wait ✅

### 9. Check Process Tool
- **Feature**: Query status of background processes
- **Implementation**: `alfred-cli.js:435-447, 564-593`
- **Returns**:
  - Running time
  - Current captured output
  - Status message
- **Guidance**: Suggests using wait_for_logs ✅

### 10. Iteration Budget Management
- **Feature**: Maximum 20 iterations to prevent runaway
- **Implementation**: `alfred-cli.js:516, 654-657`
- **User Visibility**: Shows iteration count (X/20) ✅

## 🔄 Architecture Verification

### Process Management
- ✅ Constructor initializes all maps (runningProcesses, errorHistory, pendingAgentUpdates)
- ✅ Processes stored with closure-based getNewLogs function
- ✅ No duplicate event listeners (fixed)
- ✅ Cleanup kills all background processes on exit

### Log Flow
1. ✅ Code executes → output to stdout/stderr
2. ✅ Captured in local variables with closure
3. ✅ Streamed to console with [processId] prefix
4. ✅ Every 60s: getNewLogs() called, logs cleared, queued for agent
5. ✅ Agent turn: pending updates injected as user message
6. ✅ No repetition: logs only delivered once

### Tool Chain
- ✅ execute: Spawns process, returns after 3s or completion
- ✅ wait_for_logs: Efficient 60s wait for updates
- ✅ check_process: Query current status
- ✅ kill_process: Terminate and get final logs
- ✅ All tools registered in anthropic.messages.create()

### Agent Knowledge
- ✅ Comprehensive execution model in tool description
- ✅ Best practices for ports, errors, validation
- ✅ Workflow examples
- ✅ Clear instructions on when to use each tool

## 🧪 Test Coverage

### Unit Tests (test-alfred-features.js)
- ✅ Bash stdin mode (shell parsing fix)
- ✅ Process tracking with getNewLogs closure
- ✅ Error history tracking
- ✅ Pending updates queue management
- ✅ 3-second timeout resolution logic

### Integration Tests Needed
- ⏳ Full workflow: start server → wait → test → kill
- ⏳ 60s log clearing verification
- ⏳ Multiple concurrent background processes
- ⏳ Error repetition detection in practice

## 📊 Code Quality

- ✅ Syntax check passed (node -c alfred-cli.js)
- ✅ No duplicate features (audited)
- ✅ Proper cleanup on exit (SIGINT, SIGTERM)
- ✅ Error handling in all tool handlers
- ✅ Comprehensive console logging for user visibility

## 🎯 Expected Performance Improvement

### Before (from test log analysis):
- 41 iterations for Express + Playwright test
- Bash syntax errors: 8+ wasted iterations
- Port conflicts: 22+ wasted iterations
- Playwright timeouts: 5+ wasted iterations
- JSON parsing errors: 4+ wasted iterations

### After (projected):
- **8-12 iterations** for same task (70% reduction)
- Bash syntax errors: 0 (fixed)
- Port conflicts: Detected immediately
- Timeouts: Agent switches approach after 2
- JSON errors: Validation guidance provided
